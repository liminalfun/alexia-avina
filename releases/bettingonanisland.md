    lyrics: |-
      when I walk I try to keep <br>

      my mind warm with a swarm of every reverie <br><br>



      when you walk along the edge I feel untied <br>

      it burns faster once lit <br>

      I set my feet upon the mattress and close the blinds <br><br>



      would you comb my hair slowly and blow it dry <br>

      it's a walk to go between our houses but I don't mind
  - lyrics: |-
      yes I can be a glove <br>

      it may hurt a little <br>

      but not enough <br>

      and I knew it would <br><br>



      feeling all the time like a graveyard in disguise <br>

      I've made up my mind <br>

      resurrect me till I'm kind <br><br>



      and I knew it would <br>

      and I know we should <br>

      and I knew it couldn't <br>

      be
    songtitle: Glove
  - lyrics: |-
      I'm not afraid to try <br>

      to swim into the deeper side <br>

      of this sentimental breed <br>

      of truth and other things that hide <br>

      she was the only one I had <br>

      and I couldn't hold her back <br><br>



      I was walking to the water <br>

      wasn't talking, swallowed harder <br>

      oh, I am bad <br>
    songtitle: Bad
  - songtitle: X
    lyrics: |-
      look at me <br>

      I feel all of the things I do in the way you move <br>

      we could be happy <br>

      if the sun could leave the moon <br>

      oh I need you to <br>

      speak slowly <br>

      I'm not ready to be lonely <br>

      I'm not ready to be <br>

      a freak, hold me <br>

      I've been holding this dream closely <br>

      I'm all too sure of what it means
  - lyrics: |-
      don't you ever worry <br>

      about all of the things you lack <br>

      it isn't your problem <br>

      to be all of the words you keep in tact <br> <br>



      don't you give <br>

      into the ethos <br>

      don't you swim <br>

      through the ethos <br> <br>



      do you think I'm stupid <br>

      I'm not all of the things <br>

      I want to be <br>

      but now I'm not the only <br>

      the only one of us who can't relax
