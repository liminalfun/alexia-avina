      baby, I can't stay <br>

      lying awake in your dark <br>

      while my rain waits to fall <br>

      <br>

      baby, I can't say <br>

      what this has made <br>

      me weigh in my palms

  - body: |-
      bathing in a golden light <br>

      I found him with his eyes closed slightly <br>

      wandering through some melody <br>

      his head an orb nodding slightly <br>

      my mind's a path burning blindly <br>

      back into a distant dream <br>

      pacing in my sleep
    songtitle: Dream
