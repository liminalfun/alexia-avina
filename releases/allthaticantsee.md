    lyrics: |-
      baby, I can't stay
      lying awake in your dark
      while my rain waits to fall

      baby, I can't say
      what this has made
      me weigh in my palms
    body: |-
      baby, I can't stay / 
      lying awake in your dark / 
      while my rain waits to fall / 

      baby, I can't say / 
      what this has made / 
      me weigh in my palms
  - songtitle: Dream
    body: |-
      bathing in a golden light /
      I found him with his eyes closed slightly /
      wandering through some melody /
      his head an orb nodding slightly /
      my mind's a path burning blindly /
      back into a distant dream /
      pacing in my sleep

<section class="accordion-wrapper">
  <button class="accordion">
    Adult
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      baby, I can't stay
lying awake in your dark
while my rain waits to fall

baby, I can't say
what this has made
me weigh in my palms
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">
    Dream
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      bathing in a golden light
I found him with his eyes closed slightly
wandering through some melody
his head an orb nodding slightly
my mind's a path burning blindly
back into a distant dream
pacing in my sleep
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">
    Attitude
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      painting the walls brown while I'm leaning
I watched the floorboards with the feeling
that I'd known this cold wind all along

could it have been my attitude
the way we slept in this room

traced in your body the same break of the ocean, fluid flame
and an icy void inside of me
swirled down deep into my knees
you spoke of darkness and honesty

could it have been your attitude
the weightless drift into ruin
    </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">
    All That I Can't See
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
     all that I can't see
wraps around me
like a memory of fear
aching for some place safe
to make a home
oh, what does it take from me

if I were a lake
my body wouldn't break
beneath its own weight

hold me up higher
wind in my face
still I can't
    </p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">
    A Ficus Tree
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
    didn't you think it was fun
the way we stared at the sun
you said you wished
you shone like it

I looked to you and I felt warmth
we walked outside to free the form
golden purple was the wind
how could one miss a view like this

to feel more like a child
    </p>
  </div>

<button class="accordion">
    Like Fog
  </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
    like fog my mind collects on windows concealed in thought
the kind of white haze that reveals where I know I'm not
does it last, if I fall back

like moss i am seeking through shadow a bed of rock
to turn the dark glare of an edge into something soft
if i hold back, does it last and last
    </p>
  </div>
