  - lyrics: |-
      baby, I can't stay <br>

      lying awake in your dark <br>

      while my rain waits to fall <br>

      <br>

      baby, I can't say <br>

      what this has made <br>

      me weigh in my palms
    songtitle: Adult
  - lyrics: |-
      bathing in a golden light <br>

      I found him with his eyes closed slightly <br>

      wandering through some melody <br>

      his head an orb nodding slightly <br>

      my mind's a path burning blindly <br>

      back into a distant dream <br>

      pacing in my sleep
    songtitle: Dream
  - songtitle: Attitude
    lyrics: |-
      painting the walls brown while I'm leaning <br>

      I watched the floorboards with the feeling <br>

      that I'd known this cold wind all along <br> <br>

      could it have been my attitude <br>

      the way we slept in this room <br> <br>

      traced in your body the same break of the ocean, fluid flame <br>

      and an icy void inside of me <br>

      swirled down deep into my knees <br>

      you spoke of darkness and honesty <br>

      could it have been your attitude <br>

      the weightless drift into ruin
  - lyrics: |-
      you could have fooled me then by saying we were only friends

      stepping down the sidewalk searching for the right bend

      enter the parking lot where I picked apart the look

      you gave me in the backseat hoping that I would not find

      a tear in such a bright light

      I dreamt I found you there

      in your room up the stairs

      staring through a distance I couldn't begin to bear

      you dreamt that we fell right

      in the snow on our sides

      smiling into something eternal in you and I

      oh, to find a tear inside a white light.
    songtitle: Friends
  - lyrics: |-
      all that I can't see <br>

      wraps around me <br>

      like a memory of fear <br>

      aching for some place safe <br>

      to make a home <br>

      oh, what does it take from me <br> <br>



      if I were a lake <br>

      my lyrics wouldn't break <br>

      beneath its own weight <br><br>



      hold me up higher <br>

      wind in my face <br>

      still I can't
    songtitle: All That I Can't See
  - lyrics: |-
      didn't you think it was fun <br>

      the way we stared at the sun <br>

      you said you wished <br>

      you shone like it <br><br>



      I looked to you and I felt warmth <br>

      we walked outside to free the form <br>

      golden purple was the wind <br>

      how could one miss a view like this <br><br>



      to feel more like a child
    songtitle: A Ficus Tree
  - songtitle: Like Fog
    lyrics: |-
      like fog my mind collects on windows concealed in thought <br>

      the kind of white haze that reveals where I know I'm not <br>

      does it last, if I fall back <br><br>



      like moss i am seeking through shadow a bed of rock <br>

      to turn the dark glare of an edge into something soft <br>

      if i hold back, does it last and last
