the last months of 2016 for me were a period marked by the practice of surrendering with equal reverence to a complex flood of emotions, difficult endings, and budding beginnings... i'd like to think this batch of songs emerged from that same stream.

available as a  *very cute* split cassette with desert bloom at:
