<p>“Alexia puts her gifted hands to our service in her craniosacral sessions. I always feel like I'm embarking on an adventure into the unknown when I go into her session room, with a safe and compassionate guide.   She's entirely comfortable with that role:  open and unjudging, with a gentle confidence in whatever direction it takes.  I've left every appointment with her so much more relaxed, with more balance in my energy flow, and a greater understanding of myself.  She tends to not give too much interpretation, but her insight is beautifully given, and very helpful if you ask for it.  A wonderful and trustworthy therapist; I fully recommend!! ” <br> <small>― Sally </small></p>

<p>“Craniosacral therapy with Alexia has helped me learn to trust my body and create feelings of safety. Small nuances in her sessions led me to shift my perspective and relationship to my soma & nervous system. As a nonbinary person with complex trauma, it is often difficult for me to relax and feel safe. Alexia's practice felt effortlessly inclusive and trauma-informed. Her patience and receptiveness to subtlety was significant in my personal healing journey because she modeled for me what it feels like for my body to be listened to, respected, and trusted.”<br><small>

## what to expect during a session

"A typical CST session lasts from 45-60 minutes, and takes place in a quiet, private setting. CST is performed with the client fully clothed and lying on a comfortable massage table. Using a light touch, the therapist evaluates or “listens to” the body for tension patterns and imbalances. The craniosacral system is accessed and treated using the bones and connective tissue. Skilled CST therapists can enhance fluid flow and balance membrane tension, helping to bring increased vitality to the system. Releasing chronic tension patterns and enhancing fluid motility allows the body’s healing mechanisms to operate more effectively, imparting greater balance and ease. What is experienced during a CST session is highly individualized. Some say they feel deeply relaxed, while others describe feeling unwinding sensations as the body releases tension. Sometimes, circumstances are recalled surrounding a past trauma or injury that caused the body stress. While this doesn’t happen every time, this process called “SomatoEmotional Release” is perfectly normal and helps the body reverse dysfunction and restore optimal levels of mobility."
