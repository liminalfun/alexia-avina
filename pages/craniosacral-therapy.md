"Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy (BCST) is a healing modality that connects with the wisdom of your body to heal itself. A BCST practitioner uses gentle touch to bring to your awareness a state of being and wellness where deep healing can occur.

Everyone has the ability to heal from within. Beneath our pain and suffering there is life energy present that can improve our lives, we call this primary respiration. You will be amazed as you uncover your phenomenal potential for love, serenity and connection through this profound healing modality." – _Emily LeBlanc_

## what to expect during a session

“Hope locates itself in the premises that we don’t know what will happen and that in the spaciousness of uncertainty is room to act. When you recognize uncertainty, you recognize that you may be able to influence the outcomes–you alone or you in concert with a few dozen or several million others. Hope is an embrace of the unknown and knowable, a alternative to the certainty of both optimists and pessimists. Optimists think it will all be fine without our involvement; pessimists take the opposite position; both excuse themselves from acting. It’s the belief that what we do matters even though how and when it may matter, who and what is may impact, are not things we can know beforehand. We may not, in fact, know them afterward either, but they matter all the same, and history is full of people whose influence was most powerful after they were gone.”
― _Rebecca Solnit, Hope in the Dark_
