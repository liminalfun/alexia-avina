Hello, sweet friends. My name is Alexia. I write and record my own music and sometimes travel the world to various DIY spaces, venues, churches, and galleries to play for people. I am also a biodynamic craniosacral therapist in training. Thanks for finding your way to my Patreon page.\

I am currently working on a website so that you can learn more about me and my work (and book healing sessions with me), but you can find my 'ambient-folk' music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/08SD2vwQpHuHq8IiTM180I), [Bandcamp](https://alexiaavina.bandcamp.com/), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/alexia-avina/1338781702), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/alexiaavina) etc.
